<h1>Stop Trump</h1>
<p>President Donald Trump has upset some Limeys with his immigration policy. You're a UK Border Guard and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, has instructed you to Stop Trump entering the country. As you ask new arrivals for their papers, please, can you spot Trump as he tries to sneak in? Get it right or the Queen will royally penalise you. If you prefer the alternative view, you can choose Trump mode, play as Donald Trump and make sure only your supporters get in. How do you like them apples, Britain!</p>
